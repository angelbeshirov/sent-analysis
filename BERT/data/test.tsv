3	the film provides some great insight into the neurotic mindset of all comics -- even those who have reached the absolute top of the game .
4	offers that rare combination of entertainment and education .
5	perhaps no picture ever made has more literally showed that the road to hell is paved with good intentions .
6	steers turns in a snappy screenplay that curls at the edges ; it 's so clever you want to hate it .
7	but he somehow pulls it off .
8	take care of my cat offers a refreshingly different slice of asian cinema .
9	this is a film well worth seeing 
10	what really surprises about wisegirls is its low-key quality and genuine tenderness .
11	-lrb- wendigo is -rrb- why we go to the cinema : to be fed through the eye 
12	one of the greatest family-oriented 
13	ultimately 
14	an utterly compelling ` who wrote it ' in which the reputation of the most famous author who ever lived comes into question .
15	illuminating if overly talky documentary .
16	a masterpiece four years in the making .
17	the movie 's ripe 
18	offers a breath of the fresh air of true sophistication .
19	a thoughtful 
20	with a cast that includes some of the top actors working in independent film 
21	a disturbing and frighteningly evocative assembly of imagery and hypnotic music composed by philip glass .
22	not for everyone 
23	scores a few points for doing what it does with a dedicated and good-hearted professionalism .
24	occasionally melodramatic 
25	an idealistic love story that brings out the latent 15-year-old romantic in everyone .
26	at about 95 minutes 
27	however 
28	it helps that lil bow wow ... tones down his pint-sized gangsta act to play someone who resembles a real kid .
29	guaranteed to move anyone who ever shook 
30	a masterful film from a master filmmaker 
31	light 
32	if there 's a way to effectively teach kids about the dangers of drugs 
33	while it would be easy to give crush the new title of two weddings and a funeral 
34	though everything might be literate and smart 
35	cantet perfectly captures the hotel lobbies 
36	ms. fulford-wierzbicki is almost spooky in her sulky 
37	though it is by no means his best work 
38	like most bond outings in recent years 
39	a heavy reliance on cgi technology is beginning to creep into the series .
40	newton draws our attention like a magnet 
41	the story loses its bite in a last-minute happy ending that 's even less plausible than the rest of the picture .
42	much of the way 
43	fuller would surely have called this gutsy and at times exhilarating movie a great yarn .
44	the film makes a strong case for the importance of the musicians in creating the motown sound .
45	karmen moves like rhythm itself 
46	gosling provides an amazing performance that dwarfs everything else in the film .
47	a real movie 
48	tender yet lacerating and darkly funny fable .
49	may be spoofing an easy target -- those old ' 50 's giant creature features -- but ... it acknowledges and celebrates their cheesiness as the reason why people get a kick out of watching them today .
50	an engaging overview of johnson 's eccentric career .
51	in its ragged 
52	some actors have so much charisma that you 'd be happy to listen to them reading the phone book .
53	hugh grant and sandra bullock are two such likeable actors .
54	sandra nettelbeck beautifully orchestrates the transformation of the chilly 
55	behind the snow games and lovable siberian huskies -lrb- plus one sheep dog -rrb- 
56	everytime you think undercover brother has run out of steam 
57	manages to be original 
58	a pleasant enough movie 
59	this is the best american movie about troubled teens since 1998 's whatever .
60	disney has always been hit-or-miss when bringing beloved kids ' books to the screen ... tuck everlasting is a little of both .
61	the animated subplot keenly depicts the inner struggles of our adolescent heroes - insecure 
62	the invincible werner herzog is alive and well and living in la
63	morton is a great actress portraying a complex character 
64	son of the bride may be a good half-hour too long but comes replete with a flattering sense of mystery and quietness .
65	a simmering psychological drama in which the bursts of sudden violence are all the more startling for the slow buildup that has preceded them .
66	a taut 
67	a truly moving experience 
68	this delicately observed story 
69	at heart the movie is a deftly wrought suspense yarn whose richer shadings work as coloring rather than substance .
70	the appearance of treebeard and gollum 's expanded role will either have you loving what you 're seeing 
71	i loved it !
72	gollum 's ` performance ' is incredible !
73	if this movie were a book 
74	haneke challenges us to confront the reality of sexual aberration .
75	absorbing and disturbing -- perhaps more disturbing than originally intended -- but a little clarity would have gone a long way .
76	it 's the best film of the year so far 
77	painful to watch 
78	this is a startling film that gives you a fascinating 
79	a few artsy flourishes aside 
80	while the isle is both preposterous and thoroughly misogynistic 
81	together 
82	in the process 
83	director kapur is a filmmaker with a real flair for epic landscapes and adventure 
84	the movie is a blast of educational energy 
85	a sports movie with action that 's exciting on the field and a story you care about off it .
86	doug liman 
87	the tenderness of the piece is still intact .
88	katz uses archival footage 
89	like the film 's almost anthropologically detailed realization of early - '80s suburbia 
90	while mcfarlane 's animation lifts the film firmly above the level of other coming-of-age films ... it 's also so jarring that it 's hard to get back into the boys ' story .
91	if nothing else 
92	in a normal screen process 
93	but in imax 3-d 
94	writer-director burger imaginatively fans the embers of a dormant national grief and curiosity that has calcified into chronic cynicism and fear .
95	... a roller-coaster ride of a movie
96	i enjoyed time of favor while i was watching it 
97	chicago is sophisticated 
98	steve irwin 's method is ernest hemmingway at accelerated speed and volume .
99	a refreshing korean film about five female high school friends who face an uphill battle when they try to take their relationships into deeper waters .
100	on the surface 
101	the values that have held the enterprise crew together through previous adventures and perils do so again-courage 
102	if it 's possible for a sequel to outshine the original 
103	a romantic comedy that operates by the rules of its own self-contained universe .
104	4 friends 
105	the film is often filled with a sense of pure wonderment and excitement not often seen in today 's cinema du sarcasm
106	it might be tempting to regard mr. andrew and his collaborators as oddballs 
107	a feel-good picture in the best sense of the term .
108	edited and shot with a syncopated style mimicking the work of his subjects 
109	a mostly intelligent 
110	it 's this memory-as-identity obviation that gives secret life its intermittent unease 
111	hip-hop has a history 
112	in scope 
113	this may not have the dramatic gut-wrenching impact of other holocaust films

116	a gentle 
117	somewhere short of tremors on the modern b-scene : neither as funny nor as clever

123	a classy item by a legend who may have nothing left to prove but still has the chops and drive to show how its done .
124	it is nature against progress .
125	in fessenden 's horror trilogy 
126	it 's not exactly a gourmet meal but the fare is fair 
127	this is what imax was made for : strap on a pair of 3-d goggles 
128	merely as a technical 
129	-lrb- schweiger is -rrb- talented and terribly charismatic 
130	it 's a great deal of sizzle and very little steak .
131	but what spectacular sizzle it is !
132	... in this incarnation its fizz is infectious .
133	an original gem about an obsession with time .
134	it will delight newcomers to the story and those who know it from bygone days .
135	gloriously goofy -lrb- and gory -rrb- midnight movie stuff .
136	the film overcomes the regular minefield of coming-of-age cliches with potent doses of honesty and sensitivity .
137	if your senses have n't been dulled by slasher films and gorefests 
138	it 's a minor comedy that tries to balance sweetness with coarseness 
139	it is intensely personal and yet -- unlike quills -- deftly shows us the temper of the times .
140	as lo-fi as the special effects are 
141	like mike does n't win any points for originality .
142	it does succeed by following a feel-good formula with a winning style 
143	it 's a hoot and a half 
144	far from perfect

146	waydowntown is by no means a perfect film 
147	tim allen is great in his role but never hogs the scenes from his fellow cast 
148	more a load of enjoyable

150	here 's a british flick gleefully unconcerned with plausibility 
151	it 's an old story 
152	must be seen to be believed .

154	everything that has to do with yvan and charlotte 
155	the year 's happiest surprise 
156	fans of behan 's work and of irish movies in general will be rewarded by borstal boy .
157	its mysteries are transparently obvious 
158	-lrb- but it 's -rrb- worth recommending because of two marvelous performances by michael caine and brendan fraser .
159	the film is faithful to what one presumes are the book 's twin premises -- that we become who we are on the backs of our parents 
160	stephen earnhart 's homespun documentary mule skinner blues has nothing but love for its posse of trailer park denizens .
161	a solidly seaworthy chiller .
162	if you can get past the fantastical aspects and harsh realities of `` the isle '' you 'll get a sock-you-in-the-eye flick that is a visual tour-de-force and a story that is unlike any you will likely see anywhere else .
163	there are as many misses as hits 
164	a well-made thriller with a certain level of intelligence and non-reactionary morality .
165	there 's enough science to make it count as educational

167	makmalbaf follows a resolutely realistic path in this uncompromising insight into the harsh existence of the kurdish refugees of iran 's borderlands .
168	for a good chunk of its running time 
169	most of crush is a clever and captivating romantic comedy with a welcome pinch of tartness .
170	nair does capture the complexity of a big family and its trials and tribulations ...

174	engagingly captures the maddening and magnetic ebb and flow of friendship .
175	an experience so engrossing it is like being buried in a new environment .
176	it 's traditional moviemaking all the way 
177	maybe it 's just because this past year has seen the release of some of the worst film comedies in decades ... but honestly 
178	a droll 
179	this is simply the most fun you 'll ever have with a documentary !
180	a very funny movie .
181	watching haneke 's film is 
182	but watching huppert 
183	a cop story that understands the medium amazingly well .
184	britney has been delivered to the big screen safe and sound

200	as an entertainment 
201	it is interesting and fun to see goodall and her chimpanzees on the bigger-than-life screen .
202	it wo n't bust your gut -- and it 's not intended to -- it 's merely a blandly cinematic surgical examination of what makes a joke a joke .
203	a somewhat crudely constructed but gripping 
204	it extends the writings of jean genet and john rechy 
205	narc may not get an ` a ' for originality

276	thankfully 
277	ultimately 
278	if you 're like me 
279	the film has just enough of everything -- re-enactments 
280	there are a few stabs at absurdist comedy ... but mostly the humor is of the sweet 
281	a wonderful character-based comedy .
282	it would be interesting to hear from the other side

288	the tone is balanced 
289	the principals in this cast are all fine 
290	it could change america 
291	what 's most striking about this largely celebratory film ... is the sense of isolation that permeates these bastions of individuality in an ikea world .

300	legendary irish writer brendan behan 's memoir 
301	the film 's greatest asset is how much it 's not just another connect-the-dots 
302	this clever caper movie has twists worthy of david mamet and is enormous fun for thinking audiences .
303	it 's one of the saddest films i have ever seen that still manages to be uplifting but not overly sentimental .
304	morton is 
305	even with all those rough edges safely sanded down 
306	i do n't know precisely what to make of steven soderbergh 's full frontal 
307	the tug of war that ensues is as much a snapshot of modern china in microcosm as it is a crash course in movie mythology .
308	nearly surreal 
309	i enjoyed the ride -lrb- bumps and all -rrb- 
310	you could say that it 's slow at times 
311	asia authors herself as anna battista 
312	roman coppola may never become the filmmaker his dad was 
313	but based on cq 
314	an amusing

317	finally 
318	it 's not so much enjoyable to watch as it is enlightening to listen to new sides of a previous reality 
319	spielberg is the rare director who does not want to invite viewers to gawk at or applaud his special effects .
320	he just wants them to be part of the action 
321	here

346	foster nails the role 
347	even if you ca n't pronounce `` gyro '' correctly

349	farrell ... thankfully manages to outshine the role and successfully plays the foil to willis 's world-weary colonel .
350	audiences conditioned to getting weepy over saucer-eyed 
351	bennett 's dramatization of her personal descent into post-breakup perdition has a morbid appeal that 's tough to shake .
352	an intriguing and entertaining introduction to johnson .
353	as expected 
354	a model of what films like this should be like .
355	as weber and weissman demonstrate with such insight and celebratory verve 
356	yeah 
357	is n't it great ?
358	an unbelievably fun film just a leading man away from perfection .
359	over-the-top and a bit ostentatious 
360	... a poignant and powerful narrative that reveals that reading writing and arithmetic are not the only subjects to learn in life .
361	nicely serves as an examination of a society in transition .
362	a tender and touching drama 
363	as a randy film about sexy people in gorgeous places being pushed and pulled -lrb- literally and figuratively -rrb- by desire ... -lrb- sex and lucía -rrb- makes for an arousing good time .
364	celebrated at sundance 
365	renner 's performance as dahmer is unforgettable 
366	if no one singles out any of these performances as award-worthy 
367	though of particular interest to students and enthusiast of international dance and world music 
368	energetic and boldly provocative .
369	star wars is back in a major way .
370	it 's a movie -- and an album -- you wo n't want to miss .
371	it 's rare to find a film that dazzles the eye 
372	while not all transitions to adulthood are so fraught 
373	if there 's nothing fresh about wannabes 
374	jacquot 's tosca is a treat .
375	by the end of no such thing the audience 
376	if you liked such movies as notting hill 
377	... the gentle melding of drama and comedy makes `` what time is it there ? ''
378	something the true film buff will enjoy .
379	romanek keeps the film constantly taut ... reflecting the character 's instability with a metaphorical visual style and an unnerving 
380	i whole-heartedly recommend that everyone see this movie -- for its historical significance alone .
381	hey 
382	longley has constructed a remarkably coherent 
383	although it bangs a very cliched drum at times 
384	often gruelling and heartbreaking to witness 
385	go see it and enjoy .
386	the stunning 
387	george clooney proves he 's quite a talented director and sam rockwell shows us he 's a world-class actor with confessions of a dangerous mind .
388	there 's a vastness implied in metropolis that is just breathtaking .
389	murderous maids may well be the most comprehensive of these films and also strike closest to the truth .

393	a deceivingly simple film 
394	ana is a vivid 
395	a slick

995	my oh my 
996	the two leads chomp considerably more scenery with their acting than fire-breathing monsters barbecue with their breath ...
997	cedar takes a very open-minded approach to this sensitive material 
998	biggie and tupac is so single-mindedly daring 
999	so many documentaries like this presuppose religious bigotry or zealous nuttiness of its antagonists 
1000	the cast is uniformly excellent and relaxed .
1001	after making several adaptations of other writers ' work 
1002	the film is painfully authentic 
1003	if it seems like a minor miracle that its septuagenarian star is young enough to be the nonagenarian filmmaker 's son 
1004	a candid and often fascinating documentary about a pentecostal church in dallas that assembles an elaborate haunted house each year to scare teenagers into attending services .
1005	fans of the animated wildlife adventure show will be in warthog heaven ; others need not necessarily apply .
1006	without resorting to hyperbole 
1007	nolan bravely treads where few american films dare to delve -- into the world of ambivalence and ambiguity ...

1009	a potent allegorical love story .
1010	even those who would like to dismiss the film outright should find much to mull and debate .
1011	this is cool 
1012	the movie is full of fine performances 
1013	a captivating cross-cultural comedy of manners .
1014	andy garcia enjoys one of his richest roles in years and mick jagger gives his best movie performance since 
1015	the movie is n't always easy to look at .
1016	but if it is indeed a duty of art to reflect life 
1017	it 's -lrb- ricci 's -rrb- best work yet 
1018	highlights are the terrific performances by christopher plummer 
1019	-lrb- howard -rrb- so good as leon barlow ... that he hardly seems to be acting .
1020	superior genre storytelling 
1021	by taking entertainment tonight subject matter and giving it humor and poignancy 
1022	it 's a bittersweet and lyrical mix of elements .
1023	subversive 
1024	the weakest of the four harry potter books has been transformed into the stronger of the two films by the thinnest of margins .
1025	its gross-out gags and colorful set pieces ... are of course stultifyingly contrived and too stylized by half .
1026	still 
1027	it further declares its director

1042	this time out 
1043	human resources was a good

1046	to the film 's credit 
1047	chicago is 
1048	shainberg weaves a carefully balanced scenario that is controlled by neither character 
1049	even when foreign directors ... borrow stuff from hollywood 
1050	a cockamamie tone poem pitched precipitously between swoony lyricism and violent catastrophe ... the most aggressively nerve-wracking and screamingly neurotic romantic comedy in cinema history .
1051	sturdy 
1052	whether -lrb- binoche and magimel -rrb- are being charming or angst-ridden 
1053	a spunky 
1054	it 's a glorious groove that leaves you wanting more .
1055	majidi gets uniformly engaging performances from his largely amateur cast .
1056	... a well-observed and disturbing little movie
1057	fans of nijinsky will savor every minute of cox 's work .
1058	everything you loved about it in 1982 is still there 
1059	jagger the actor is someone you want to see again .
1060	escapism in its purest form .
1061	there is a kind of attentive concern that hoffman brings to his characters 
1062	a comic gem with some serious sparkles .
1063	u.s. audiences may find -lrb- attal and gainsbourg 's -rrb- unfamiliar personas give the film an intimate and quaint reality that is a little closer to human nature than what hollywood typically concocts .
1064	once again 
1065	a loving little film of considerable appeal .
1066	although it 's a bit smug and repetitive 
1067	flawed but worthy look at life in u.s. relocation camps .
1068	demands too much of most viewers .
1069	the story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured -lrb- and torturing -rrb- artists and consuming but impossible love that you ca n't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on .
1070	it should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit .
1071	so i just did .
1072	shamelessly sappy and 
1073	the ring just left me cold and wet like i was out in the seattle drizzle without rainwear .
1074	the film seems a dead weight .
1075	the lack of pace kills it 
1076	for anyone who grew up on disney 's 1950 treasure island 
1077	a clutchy 
1078	watching scarlet diva 
1079	instead 
1080	meandering 
1081	the ending is a cop-out .
1082	what happens to john q ?
1083	i do n't have an i am sam clue .
1084	has the feel of an unedited personal journal .
1085	remember when bond had more glamour than clamor ?
1086	no more .
1087	cry havoc and let slip the dogs of cheese 
1088	this charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make jay and silent bob 's excellent adventure seem understated .
1089	it does n't quite deserve the gong 
1090	the subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one .
1091	... hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with soggy leaves .
1092	unlike his directorial efforts 
1093	the overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than 
1094	most of the supporting characters in eastwood films are weak 
1095	this one 's weaker than most .
1096	audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the castro regime in less than saintly tones .
1097	the film takes too long getting to the good stuff 
1098	you can practically smell the patchouli oil .
1099	to say analyze that is de niro 's best film since meet the parents sums up the sad state of his recent career .
1100	the actors do n't inhabit their roles -- they 're trapped by them 
1101	an often-deadly boring 
1102	this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane 
1103	consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than ali g
1104	moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance .
1105	there is no insight into the anguish of heidi 's life -- only a depiction of pain 
1106	the editing is chaotic 
1107	when -lrb- de palma 's -rrb- bad 
1108	tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films : young is cool 
1109	i doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time christmas really rolls around 
1110	uncertain in tone ... a garbled exercise in sexual politics 
1111	all 's well that ends well 
1112	the only thing worse than your substandard 
1113	if you think that jennifer lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry ben affleck 
1114	stars matthew perry and elizabeth hurley illicit more than a chuckle 
1115	it 's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull 
1116	culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character .
1117	in the end 
1118	... -lrb- like -rrb- channel surfing between the discovery channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie .
1119	a movie that 
1120	shot perhaps ` artistically ' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay 
1121	imagine a really bad community theater production of west side story without the songs .
1122	soul is what 's lacking in every character in this movie and 
1123	a one-trick pony whose few t&a bits still ca n't save itself from being unoriginal 
1124	the worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors
1125	it may be a prize winner 
1126	the production values are up there .
1127	the use of cgi and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick .
1128	the voices are fine as well .
1129	the problem 
1130	it 's got its heart in the right place 
1131	proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie .
1132	well 
1133	this overproduced and generally disappointing effort is n't likely to rouse the rush hour crowd .
1134	topkapi this is not .
1135	if shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith 
1136	ethan hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the beatnik generation and it 's all over his chelsea walls .
1137	equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama .
1138	i 'm not suggesting that you actually see it 
1139	while the film misfires at every level 
1140	if you liked the 1982 film then 
1141	a 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode tv series 
1142	guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things .
1143	she lists ingredients 
1144	audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school .
1145	to imagine the life of harry potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized woody allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is kung pow : enter the fist .
1146	it delivers some chills and sustained unease 
1147	credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter .
1148	i would have preferred a transfer down the hall to mr. holland 's class for the music 
1149	for the most part 
1150	but an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents nettelbeck 's film from coming together .
1151	an earnest 
1152	it 's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views .
1153	a mawkish 
1154	yes 
1155	it 's a film that hinges on its casting 
1156	this is a throwaway 
1157	... with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum 
1158	it 's a trifle .
1159	literally nothing in the pool is new 
1160	arguably the year 's silliest and most incoherent movie .
1161	anyway 
1162	after that 
1163	too bad 
1164	chao was chen kaige 's assistant for years in china .
1165	he has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about .
1166	a mixed bag of a comedy that ca n't really be described as out of this world .
1167	the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously .
1168	marries the amateurishness of the blair witch project with the illogic of series 7 : the contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie .
1169	the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film .
1170	if it 's another regurgitated action movie you 're after 
1171	so what is the point ?
1172	lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland 
1173	this is junk food cinema at its greasiest .
1174	when it 's all wet 
1175	when it 's on dry land 
1176	most new movies have a bright sheen .
1177	some 
1178	the story is naturally poignant 
1179	you see robert de niro singing - and dancing to - west side story show tunes .
1180	choose your reaction : a. -rrb- that sure is funny !
1181	b. -rrb- that sure is pathetic !
1182	a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards .
1183	this dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old hollywood saw : evil is interesting and good is boring .
1184	before long 
1185	the charms of willful eccentricity 
1186	instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story 
1187	but what about the countless other people who 'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ?
1188	a silly 
1189	scarlet diva has a voyeuristic tug 
1190	the character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time 
1191	flashy 
1192	lame 
1193	it 's the kind of movie that ends up festooning u.s. art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it 's in french -lrb- well 
1194	this miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty 
1195	expect to be reminded of other 
1196	nair stuffs the film with dancing 
1197	it 's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that hollywood is n't laughing with us 
1198	it 's laughing at us .
1199	might have been better off as a documentary 
1200	every good actor needs to do his or her own hamlet .
1201	for benigni it was n't shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but pinocchio .
1202	it might as well have been problem child iv .
1203	arnold 's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces .
1204	both awful and appealing .
1205	the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary .
1206	nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about .
1207	we are left with a superficial snapshot that 
1208	helmer devito ... attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics 
1209	it would n't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $ 7.00 .
1210	i hated every minute of it .
1211	-lrb- t -rrb- hose same extremes prevent us from taking its message seriously 
1212	obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of hey arnold !
1213	the movie will reach far beyond its core demographic .
1214	there 's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the disney classic 
1215	a simple 
1216	roger michell 
1217	there is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt seagal 's character ... performs is shot from behind 
1218	anthony hopkins ?
1219	big deal !
1220	we 've already seen the prequel to the silence of the lambs and hannibal -- and it was better the first time .
1221	ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power 
1222	if this is an example of the type of project that robert redford 's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to 
1223	pumpkin sits in a patch somewhere between mirthless todd solondzian satire and callow student film .
1224	not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute 
1225	it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film 
1226	it 's just incredibly dull .
1227	the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film is n't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is .
1228	a cumbersome and cliche-ridden movie greased with every emotional device known to man .
1229	director ferzan ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group 
1230	but he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person .
1231	egoyan 's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement 
1232	it wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film 
1233	despite apparent motives to the contrary 
1234	shadyac shoots his film like an m. night shyamalan movie 
1235	plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial .
1236	there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about 
1237	the story 's so preposterous that i did n't believe it for a second 
1238	i 've heard that the fans of the first men in black have come away hating the second one .
1239	i wonder why .
1240	they felt like the same movie to me .
1241	despite her relentless vim and winsome facial symmetry 
1242	an ultra-low-budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent .
1243	birot is a competent enough filmmaker 
1244	de niro and mcdormand give solid performances 
1245	even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy ... even for disney .
1246	that is essentially what 's missing from blackboards -- the sense of something bigger 
1247	a compendium of solondz 's own worst instincts in under 90 minutes .
1248	it is a comedy that 's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling -lrb- and an uneasy alliance 
1249	the story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them 
1250	you 'll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot .
1251	you 'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus .
1252	dissing a bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid 
1253	ritchie 's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted 
1254	flat 
1255	little more than a frothy vanity project .
1256	the film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending .
1257	verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action 
1258	for all its surface frenzy 
1259	the sum of all fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there 's something cringe-inducing about seeing an american football stadium nuked as pop entertainment .
1260	alex nohe 's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life 
1261	the title trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you 're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller .
1262	ihops do n't pile on this much syrup .
1263	for the most part 
1264	focuses on joan 's raging hormones and sledgehammers the audience with spanish inquisitions about her `` madness '' so much that i became mad that i wasted 123 minutes and $ 9.50 on this 21st century torture device .
1265	this series should have died long ago 
1266	a bit of an unwieldy mess .
1267	with a story as bizarre and mysterious as this 
1268	the filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point 
1269	the movie feels like it 's going to be great 
1270	a gimmick in search of a movie : how to get carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible 
1271	... the last time i saw a theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my sats .
1272	... fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense .
1273	... lacks the punch and verve needed to make this genre soar .
1274	it 's often faintly amusing 
1275	it 's tough 
1276	largely a for-fans artifact .
1277	there 's no denying the elaborateness of the artist 's conceptions 
1278	characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better .
1279	there 's plenty of style in guillermo del toro 's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply ca n't sustain more than 90 minutes .
1280	-lrb- i -rrb- f you 've been to more than one indie flick in your life 
1281	no reason for anyone to invest their hard-earned bucks into a movie which obviously did n't invest much into itself either .
1282	a strong first quarter 
1283	a boring 
1284	the vampire thriller blade ii starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun -- toward the end 
1285	when the first few villians are introduced as `` spider '' and `` snake '' you know you 're in for a real winner 
1286	an afterschool special without the courage of its convictions .
1287	the final result makes for adequate entertainment 
1288	-lrb- director -rrb- byler may yet have a great movie in him 
1289	so few movies explore religion that it 's disappointing to see one reduce it to an idea that fits in a sampler .
1290	it 's also clear from the start that the transporter is running purely on adrenaline 
1291	watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good .
1292	it 's fun 
1293	there are touching moments in etoiles 
1294	could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes fatal attraction look like a classic by comparison ?
1295	that 's the only sane rationale i can think of for swimfan 's existence .
1296	i did n't laugh at the ongoing efforts of cube 
1297	the only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare .
1298	i wonder what the reaction of israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation .
1299	the film would work much better as a video installation in a museum 
1300	immediately .
1301	human nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy 
1302	-lrb- it 's -rrb- a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy vinnie jones 
1303	not even the hanson brothers can save it
1304	the thriller side of this movie is falling flat 
1305	... -lrb- a -rrb- strained comedy that jettisons all opportunities for rock to make his mark by serving up the usual chaotic nonsense .
1306	a sour 
1307	feels like one of those contrived 
1308	obstacles are too easily overcome and there is n't much in the way of character development in the script .
1309	it tells more than it shows .
1310	earnest falls short of its ideal predecessor largely due to parker 's ill-advised meddling with the timeless source material .
1311	the film might have been more satisfying if it had 
1312	pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick .
1313	not every animated film from disney will become a classic 
1314	do not 
1315	nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas 
1316	much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie .
1317	this is really just another genre picture .
1318	each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature

1320	a trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home .
1321	neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly well-drawn .

1323	both stars manage to be funny 
1324	`` collateral damage '' goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment -- until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief
1325	` enigma ' is a good name for a movie this delibrately obtuse and unapproachable .
1326	a waste of good performances .
1327	a dreary

1329	but i was n't .
1330	as conceived by mr. schaeffer 
1331	like so many other allegedly scary movies 
1332	the essential problem in orange county is that 
1333	just like hearst 's enormous yacht 
1334	there is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility 
1335	where last time jokes flowed out of cho 's life story 
1336	why come up with something even quasi-original 
1337	a broadly played 
1338	... too gory to be a comedy and too silly to be an effective horror film .
1339	lacks heart 
1340	though a bit of a patchwork in script and production 
1341	perfectly enjoyable 
1342	wasabi is slight fare indeed 
1343	somehow both wildly implausible and strangely conventional .
1344	this ill-fitting tuxedo is strictly off-the-rack .
1345	the premise is in extremely bad taste 
1346	sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies 
1347	kidman is really the only thing that 's worth watching in birthday girl 
1348	imagine the james woods character from videodrome making a home movie of audrey rose and showing it to the kid from the sixth sense and you 've imagined the ring .
1349	this time kaufman 's imagination has failed him .
1350	an intermittently pleasing but mostly routine effort .
1351	it becomes gimmicky instead of compelling .
1352	frenetic but not really funny .
1353	taken individually or collectively 
1354	if you 're not a prepubescent girl 
1355	a didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy .
1356	sluggishly directed by episodic tv veteran joe zwick 
1357	you could nap for an hour and not miss a thing .
1358	director clare kilner 's debut is never as daft as it should have been .
1359	new best friend should n't have gone straight to video ; it should have gone straight to a mystery science theater 3000 video .
1360	wallace seems less like he 's been burning to tell a war story than he 's been itching to somehow tack one together
1361	the thrill is -lrb- long -rrb- gone .
1362	began life as a computer game

1364	godawful boring slug of a movie .

1374	but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film .
1375	offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy 
1376	mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor .
1377	aspires for the piquant but only really achieves a sort of ridiculous sourness .
1378	accuracy and realism are terrific 
1379	for all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative

1382	although based on a real-life person 
1383	great story 
1384	with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams writer\/director\/producer robert rodriguez has cobbled together a film that feels like a sugar high gone awry .
1385	there is no entry portal in the rules of attraction 
1386	it 's hard to tell with all the crashing and banging where the salesmanship ends and the movie begins .
1387	`` my god 
1388	yes 
1389	a dreadful live-action movie .
1390	divertingly ridiculous

1409	i cry for i spy -- or i would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-tv spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind .
1410	a boring 
1411	what you would end up with if you took orwell 
1412	but that 's just the problem with it - the director has n't added enough of his own ingredients .
1413	with recent tensions rekindled by the kathleen soliah trial and the upcoming trial of sla members emily and william harris 
1414	flaunts its quirky excesses like a new year 's eve drunk sporting a paper party hat .
1415	writhing under dialogue like ` you 're from two different worlds ' and ` tonight the maid is a lie and this

1417	is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of wilco 's last album ?
1418	faultlessly professional but finally slight .
1419	schmaltzy and unfunny 
1420	it 's really yet another anemic and formulaic lethal weapon-derived buddy-cop movie 
1421	scotland 
1422	some studio pizazz might have helped .
1423	when perry fists a bull at the moore farm 
1424	there 's more scatological action in 8 crazy nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career .
1425	too loud 
1426	the cartoon is about as true to the spirit of the festival of lights as mr. deeds was to that of frank capra .
1427	... the sum of the parts equals largely a confused mediocrity .
1428	the tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy .
1429	if we do n't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose 
1430	a modest and messy metaphysical thriller offering more questions than answers .
1431	julia is played with exasperating blandness by laura regan .
1432	morrissette 's script and direction show a fair amount of intelligence and wit -- but it does n't signify a whole lot either .
1433	there 's suspension of disbelief and then there 's bad screenwriting ... this film packs a wallop of the latter .
1434	all ms. jovovich 
1435	mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty .
1436	mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness .
1437	this is a particularly toxic little bonbon 
1438	this is n't just the cliffsnotes version of nicholas nickleby 
1439	considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts 
1440	better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine .
1441	so clichéd that 
1442	it 's a decent glimpse into a time period 
1443	it might be the first sci-fi comedy that could benefit from a three 's company-style laugh track .
1444	when the plot kicks in 
1445	credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment .
1446	the movie takes itself too seriously and 
1447	-lrb- davis -rrb- has a bright 
1448	does n't amount to much of anything .
1449	bullock 's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
1450	so stupid 
1451	the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome .
1452	enduring love but exhausting cinema .
1453	some of seagal 's action pictures are guilty pleasures 
1454	a ponderous meditation on love that feels significantly longer than its relatively scant 97 minutes .
1455	a long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been .
1456	a little too pat for its own good .
1457	there are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them .

1462	when a set of pre-shooting guidelines a director came up with for his actors turns out to be cleverer 
1463	a very bad sign .
1464	it 's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject 
1465	ca n't kick about the assembled talent and the russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers .
1466	still 
1467	diane lane shines in unfaithful .
1468	almost everything else is wan .
1469	i 'm afraid you wo n't get through this frankly fantastical by-the-numbers b-flick with just a suspension of disbelief .
1470	rather 
1471	so relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something .
1472	the title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you 'll read anywhere .

1474	god help the poor woman if attal is this insecure in real life : his fictional yvan 's neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse .
1475	let 's cut to the consumer-advice bottom line : stay home .
1476	undercover brother does n't go far enough .
1477	it 's just a silly black genre spoof .

1480	you 've already seen heartbreak if you 've watched the far superior nurse betty or sunset boulevard .
1481	even the unwatchable soapdish is more original .
1482	a journey that 's too random and inconclusive to be compelling 
1483	the movie bounces all over the map .
1484	but buying into sham truths and routine `` indie '' filmmaking 
1485	it 's not horrible 
1486	not always too whimsical for its own good -lrb- but enough to do harm -rrb- 
1487	it 's a sometimes interesting remake that does n't compare to the brilliant original .
1488	you 're too conscious of the effort it takes to be this spontaneous .
1489	feel bad for king 
1490	some actors steal scenes .
1491	tom green just gives them a bad odor .
1492	this self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy stealing harvard 
1493	sometimes 
1494	the enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized .
1495	begins as a promising meditation on one of america 's most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt .
1496	a monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it .
1497	proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot 
1498	the reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then 
1499	there 's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in point pleasant .
1500	in the second half of the film 
1501	director barry skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of `` the longest yard '' playbook like a checklist .
1502	the furious coherence that -lrb- deniro -rrb- brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself 
1503	oh 
1504	extremely dumb .
1505	extremely confusing .
1506	extremely boring .
1507	we never really feel involved with the story 
1508	for a shoot - 'em - up 
1509	one minute 
1510	what happened with pluto nash ?
1511	how did it ever get made ?
1512	we may never think of band camp as a geeky or nerdy thing again .

1514	the result is solemn and horrifying 
1515	these spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds 
1516	a long slog for anyone but the most committed pokemon fan .
1517	matthew mcconaughey tries 
1518	how on earth 
1519	everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique 
1520	with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles 
1521	its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent dumas botch-jobs 
1522	a benign but forgettable sci-fi diversion .
1523	the plot grinds on with yawn-provoking dullness .
1524	it 's never a good sign when a film 's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma .
1525	it 's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition .
1526	it does n't help that the director and cinematographer stephen kazmierski shoot on grungy video 
1527	desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats .
1528	this film 's relationship to actual tension is the same as what christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation .
1529	john mctiernan 's botched remake may be subtler than norman jewison 's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga .
1530	it 's also stupider .
1531	director dirk shafer and co-writer greg hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama .
1532	borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu .
1533	as -lrb- the characters -rrb- get more depressed 
1534	the acting by the over-25s lacks spark 
1535	though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director 
1536	falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that are n't funny .
1537	the fight scenes are fun 
1538	anyone who can count to five -lrb- the film 's target market ? -rrb-
1539	can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going .
1540	all this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull .
1541	demme 's loose approach kills the suspense .
1542	this idea has lost its originality ... and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture .
1543	-lrb- plays -rrb- in broad outline as pandering middle-age buddy-comedy .
1544	the film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime 
1545	nothing more than a mediocre trifle .
1546	a turgid little history lesson 
1547	too silly to be frightening 
1548	if kaufman kept cameron diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape 
1549	trivial where it should be profound 
1550	it would be hard to think of a recent movie that has worked this hard to achieve this little fun .
1551	theology aside 
1552	all that -lrb- powerpuff girls -rrb- charm is present in the movie 
1553	sometimes smart but more often sophomoric .
1554	the ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch .
1555	collateral damage is 
1556	as are its star 
1557	dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it does n't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding .
1558	its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing .
1559	a great idea becomes a not-great movie .
1560	... watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life .
1561	and if the hours wins ` best picture ' i just might .
1562	by the end 
1563	not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse 
1564	feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention .
1565	life is a crock -- or something like it .
1566	made by jackasses for jackasses .
1567	despite a powerful portrayal by binoche 
1568	the picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn .
1569	bartleby is a one-joke movie 
1570	given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same 
1571	a bravura exercise in emptiness .
1572	philip k. dick must be turning in his grave 
1573	despite the premise of a good story ... it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles .
1574	all prints of this film should be sent to and buried on pluto .
1575	not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality 
1576	first good 
1577	excellent acting and direction .
1578	this goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
1579	it 's difficult to say whether the tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing -- i 'm prepared to call it a draw .
1580	even as lame horror flicks go 
1581	so routine 
1582	sunshine state lacks the kind of dynamic that limbo offers 
1583	even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles ... so it 's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that 's ultimately rather inconsequential .
1584	a long-winded 
1585	too close to phantom menace for comfort .
1586	although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor 
1587	too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining .
1588	this movie is about lying 
1589	it smacks of purely commercial motivation 
1590	melanie eventually slugs the yankee .
1591	too bad the former murphy brown does n't pop reese back .
1592	at the bottom rung of the series ' entries .
1593	a real clunker .
1594	a well-made 
1595	a dreary rip-off of goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for hispanic americans .
1596	the picture 
1597	good for a few unintentional laughs 
1598	... a big 
1599	a frustrating combination of strained humor and heavy-handed sentimentality .
1600	lawrence preaches strictly to the converted .
1601	as written by michael berg and michael j. wilson from a story by wilson 
1602	will probably stay in the shadow of its two older 
1603	just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety 
1604	choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy .
1605	... the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex 
1606	the only thing in pauline and paulette that you have n't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers .
1607	if you 're looking for comedy to be served up 
1608	it virtually defines a comedy that 's strongly mediocre 
1609	an instant candidate for worst movie of the year .
1610	despite its title 
1611	like a tone-deaf singer at a benefit concert 
1612	adam sandler is to gary cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse .
1613	what kids will discover is a new collectible .
1614	what parents will suspect is that they 're watching a 76-minute commercial .
1615	beers 
1616	without september 11 
1617	now it 's a bad 
1618	drags along in a dazed and enervated 
1619	there 's a disturbing ` great white hope ' undertone to the other side of heaven that subtly undermines its message of christian love and compassion .
1620	unless you are in dire need of a diesel fix 
1621	wait for video -- and then do n't rent it .
1622	the attempt is courageous 
1623	there 's something fundamental missing from this story : something or someone to care about .
1624	too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger 
1625	when a film is created solely because it 's a marketable product 
1626	let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested .
1627	unfortunately 
1628	the more kevin costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels 
1629	-lrb- it 's -rrb- difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of american chai 
1630	the latest installment in the pokemon canon 
1631	taken purely as an exercise in style 
1632	but as a movie 
1633	if myers decides to make another austin powers movie 
1634	the backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense .
1635	too stupid to be satire 
1636	overly stylized with lots of flash black - & - white freeze frames reminiscent of a pseudo-hip luxury car commercial 
1637	what is captured during the conceptual process does n't add up to a sufficient explanation of what the final dance work 
1638	if this is satire 
1639	had the film boasted a clearer 
1640	these people would n't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance .
1641	imagine if you will a tony hawk skating video interspliced with footage from behind enemy lines and set to jersey shore techno .
1642	it does n't quite work 
1643	any film featuring young children threatened by a terrorist bomb can no longer pass as mere entertainment .
1644	the director 's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship -lrb- most notably wretched sound design -rrb- .
1645	about as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through .
1646	apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths .
1647	marisa tomei is good 
1648	opens at a funeral 
1649	the noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in sorority boys 
1650	to portray modern women the way director davis has done is just unthinkable .
1651	too simple for its own good .
1652	flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey .
1653	a chaotic panorama that 's too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags .
1654	suffers from rambling 
1655	the screenplay sabotages the movie 's strengths at almost every juncture .
1656	all the characters are stereotypes 
1657	a trashy 
1658	the performances are so leaden 
1659	a subtle variation on i spit on your grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men .
1660	reggio 's trippy 
1661	as tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool 
1662	if somebody was bored and ... decided to make a dull 
1663	the best you can say about it is it 's so uninspired 
1664	a tough go 
1665	an overstuffed compendium of teen-catholic-movie dogma .
1666	too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good 
1667	ben affleck as jack ryan 
1668	ridiculous .
1669	what 's next ?
1670	d.j. qualls as indiana jones ?
1671	or tom green as han solo ?
1672	the movie 's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension .
1673	the film is directed by wally wolodarsky from a script by joe jarvis and greg coolidge .
1674	these are names to remember 
1675	if this is the resurrection of the halloween franchise 
1676	this formulaic chiller will do little to boost stallone 's career .
1677	i saw knockaround guys yesterday 
1678	though avary has done his best to make something out of ellis ' nothing novel 
1679	the average local news columnist has a bigger rant on the war between modern landscape architecture and small-town america .
1680	no worse than a lot of the crap we 've been offered this summer 
1681	the plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset .
1682	at first 
1683	never again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and 
1684	the story itself is uninteresting 
1685	technically 
1686	the title 's lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is .
1687	the parts are better than the whole -lrb- bizarre 
1688	while the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an american movie might demand 
1689	the humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch 
1690	it 's a movie forged in the fires of chick flick hell .
1691	its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper .
1692	any one episode of the sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes .
1693	feels like the grittiest movie that was ever made for the lifetime cable television network .
1694	lanie 's professional success means she must be a failure at life 
1695	credit must be given to harland williams 
1696	denzel washington 's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony .
1697	if this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift 
1698	so faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban 
1699	rambles on in a disjointed 
1700	there 's an audience for it 
1701	i can only imagine one thing worse than kevin spacey trying on an irish accent 
1702	an awkward and indigestible movie .
1703	the movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs .
1704	haneke keeps us at arm 's length .
1705	guided more by intellect than heart 
1706	all the well-meaningness in the world ca n't erase the fact that the believer feels like a 12-step program for the jewish nazi .
1707	like most sequels 
1708	there 's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong .
1709	this is an hour and a half of daydreaming .
1710	message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ?
1711	alas 
1712	no movement 
1713	` dragonfly ' is a movie about a bus wreck that turns into a film wreck .
1714	thirty years ago 
1715	now it 's just tired .
1716	heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension .
1717	the movie is too cute to take itself too seriously 
1718	a thinly veiled excuse for wilson to play his self-deprecating act against murphy 's well-honed prima donna shtick .
1719	a minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it 's sort of true and it 's sort of bogus and it 's ho-hum all the way through .
1720	the movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark .
1721	plays as hollow catharsis 
1722	it will come as no surprise that the movie is n't scary .
1723	but here 's the real damn : it is n't funny 
1724	quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ?
1725	the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film 
1726	what you get with empire is a movie you 've seen many times before 
1727	cho 's fans are sure to be entertained ; it 's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- i 'm not one of them .
1728	looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter 's imagination .
1729	the period -- swinging london in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in gangster no. 1 
1730	high crimes miscasts nearly every leading character .
1731	the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy 
1732	de niro looks bored 
1733	i did n't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot .
1734	another rent installment for the ian fleming estate .
1735	with danilo donati 's witty designs and dante spinotti 's luscious cinematography 
1736	so lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun .
1737	though it draws several decent laughs 
1738	has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags .
1739	well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons .
1740	sadly 
1741	if melville is creatively a great whale 
1742	this film is so slick 
1743	just one more collection of penis 
1744	or a profit .
1745	or some damn thing .
1746	the acting is stiff 
1747	enough trivializes an important crisis 
1748	the makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and 
1749	i like frank the pug 
1750	a restrained ribisi convinces as an italian 
1751	gee 
1752	moot point .
1753	a hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face .
1754	needless to say 
1755	the problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise 
1756	madonna still ca n't act a lick .
1757	even the imaginative gore ca n't hide the musty scent of todd farmer 's screenplay 
1758	if you pitch your expectations at an all time low 
1759	the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life .
1760	but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored .
1761	serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and 
1762	but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .
1763	do n't let your festive spirit go this far .
1764	though the book runs only about 300 pages 
1765	hey 
1766	intended to be a comedy about relationships 
1767	sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary .
1768	director brian levant 
1769	... perhaps the heaviest 
1770	suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle 
1771	i 'd give real money to see the perpetrators of chicago torn apart by dingoes .
1772	movies like this are selling the old european candor 
1773	but in 2002 
1774	the timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off .
1775	a fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy .
1776	flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind .
1777	even if you feel like you 've seen this movie a thousand times before 
1778	the story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence .
1779	despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy .
1780	mckay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness
1781	a recipe for cinematic disaster ... part quentin tarantino 
1782	the cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie 's power as a work of drama .
1783	another big 
1784	aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with townsend .
1785	when she speaks 
1786	outrageousness is all plympton seemed to be going for this time .
1787	we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride .
1788	much of what is meant to be ` inspirational ' and ` uplifting ' is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing -lrb- the movie 's -rrb- mindset .
1789	well before it 's over 
1790	home alone goes hollywood 
1791	besides 
1792	-lrb- nelson 's -rrb- movie about morally compromised figures leaves viewers feeling compromised 
1793	passion 
1794	for me 
1795	looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due .
1796	truth to tell 
1797	abandons all pretense of creating historical context and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists .
1798	even die-hard fans of japanese animation ... will find this one a challenge .
1799	filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low .
1800	fortunately for all involved 
1801	the movie gets muted and routine .
1802	the issue of faith is not explored very deeply
1803	the situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels .
1804	it 's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high .
1805	i was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness .
1806	k-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic 
1807	a very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale ... a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more .
1808	automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf .
1809	the film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off .
1810	feels less like it 's about teenagers 
1811	ja rule and kurupt should have gotten to rap .
1812	it would have benefitted the dialogue .
1813	a standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas .
1814	elicits more groans from the audience than jar jar binks 
1815	it 's badly acted 
1816	in the end 
1817	it 's a flashy 
1818	this film 
1819	you 've seen them a million times .
1820	just one problem : fish out of water usually die .
1821	this one does .
1822	the angst-ridden 
1823	a soggy 
1824	men in black ii has sequel-itis something fierce .
1825	an ungainly 
1826	a combination of standard 
1827	an unsatisfying hybrid of blair witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare 
1828	say this for the soundtrack 
1829	after seeing swept away 
1830	instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing 
1831	a gob of drivel so sickly sweet 
1832	maudlin and melodramatic we expected .
1833	boring we did n't .
1834	never quite transcends jokester status ... and the punchline does n't live up to barry 's dead-eyed 
1835	the film 's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place .
1836	it almost plays like solaris 
1837	a baffling misfire 
1838	it wo n't be long before you 'll spy i spy at a video store near you .
1839	this film looks like it was produced in 1954 
1840	propelled not by characters but by caricatures .
1841	there is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production .
1842	this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes 
1843	earnest but earthbound ... a slow 
1844	the pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film ca n't help but go soft and stinky .
1845	for all its alleged youthful fire 
1846	a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie .
1847	if i spy were funny -lrb- enough -rrb- or exciting -lrb- enough -rrb- then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it 's trying to reap from the moviegoing public .
1848	frustratingly 
1849	places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting 
1850	a very average science fiction film .
1851	undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay 
1852	how anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us .
1853	the sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap .
1854	the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself 
1855	the plot is straight off the shelf 
1856	ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance
1857	a whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness .
1858	those who managed to avoid the deconstructionist theorizing of french philosopher jacques derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary derrida .
1859	or 
1860	jolie 's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips .
1861	as with too many studio pics 
1862	static 
1863	would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year .
1864	for all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that kapur tries to bring to the four feathers 
1865	when it comes to entertainment 
1866	what the four feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about .
1867	while benigni -lrb- who stars and co-wrote -rrb- seems to be having a wonderful time 
1868	yes 
1869	preposterous and tedious 
1870	calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it 's more like entertainment for trolls .
1871	none of these characters resembles anyone you 've ever met in real life 
1872	... just a big mess of a movie 
1873	as elegantly crafted as it often is 
1874	splashes its drama all over the screen 
1875	... has virtually no script at all ...
1876	will only satisfy those who ca n't tell the difference between the good 
1877	this kind of dark comedy requires a delicate 
1878	but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick -lrb- remember cabin boy ? -rrb-
1879	just pound away .
1880	at times 
1881	rather quickly 
1882	screenwriters scott abbott and michael petroni have turned rice 's complex akasha into a cartoon monster .
1883	the writers 
1884	bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description .
1885	the new faces are interesting 
1886	most of the action setups are incoherent .
1887	liman 
1888	... surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs .
1889	the problem is n't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball .
1890	dreary 
1891	there 's something deeply creepy about never again 
1892	the problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one 
1893	sorry 
1894	a painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots .
1895	blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be 
1896	and in truth 
1897	the cartoon that is n't really good enough to be on afternoon tv is now a movie that is n't really good enough to be in theaters .
1898	shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker 's bottomless pit of self-absorption .
1899	this pep-talk for faith 
1900	all ends well 
1901	if this is the danish idea of a good time 
1902	formula 51 is so trite that even yu 's high-energy action stylings ca n't break through the stupor .
1903	only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives 
1904	when the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters 
1905	-lrb- two -rrb- fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable scandinavian settlers in 18th-century canada 
1906	the film is really not so much bad as bland .
1907	the central story lacks punch .
1908	though ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way 
1909	this may be the dumbest 
1910	succumbs to the same kind of maudlin 
1911	a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy .
1912	what was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical .
1913	the kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion .
1914	`` men in black ii 
1915	the story is less vibrant 
1916	sucking all the ` classic ' out of robert louis stevenson 's treasure island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and disney-fied adolescent angst ...
1917	this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes 
1918	while super troopers is above academy standards 
1919	a mix of velocity and idiocy 
1920	the low-budget full frontal was one of the year 's murkiest 
1921	the plot is very clever 
1922	the film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future quentin tarantino picture
1923	a free-for-all of half-baked thoughts 
1924	apallingly absurd ... the chemistry or lack thereof between newton and wahlberg could turn an imax theater into a 9 '' black and white portable tv .
1925	a well acted and well intentioned snoozer .
1926	the smug 
1927	must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry .
1928	others may find it migraine-inducing 
1929	despite its good nature and some genuinely funny moments 
1930	it 's hard not to feel you 've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story .
1931	i watched the brainless insanity of no such thing with mounting disbelief .
1932	this limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982 's tootsie 
1933	kwan makes the mix-and - match metaphors intriguing 
1934	while obviously an extremely personal work 
1935	any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes .
1936	like a marathon runner trying to finish a race 
1937	i loved looking at this movie .
1938	i just did n't care as much for the story .
1939	has all the poignancy of a hallmark card and all the comedy of a gallagher stand-up act .
1940	it does n't do the original any particular dishonor 
1941	fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense .
1942	a gorgeous 
1943	it feels like a community theater production of a great broadway play : even at its best 
1944	the film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other .
1945	the element of surprise might be the only thing femme fatale has going for it .
1946	it 's the kind of movie you ca n't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch 
1947	maybe it 's asking too much 
1948	a graceless 
1949	the story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough .
1950	based on a david leavitt story 
1951	just like every other seagal movie 
1952	to enjoy this movie 's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by jolie and burns 
1953	national lampoon 's van wilder could be the worst thing to come out of national lampoon since class reunion
1954	this is a great subject for a movie 
1955	ecks this one off your must-see list .
1956	overall 
1957	it settles for being merely grim .
1958	the irwins emerge unscathed 
1959	it 's not thirsty 
1960	no 
1961	just because it really happened to you 
1962	just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham 
1963	every so often a movie comes along that confirms one 's worse fears about civilization as we know it .
1964	the new guy is one of them .
1965	this is n't a `` friday '' worth waiting for .
1966	everything that 's worthwhile about collision course can already be seen on television .
1967	if this movie belonged to a sorority 
1968	not a cheap slasher flick 
1969	uneasy mishmash of styles and genres .
1970	herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable 
1971	all in all 
1972	beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines ... there just is n't much to laugh at .
1973	secret ballot is too contemplative to be really funny .
1974	the film 's center will not hold .
1975	myers never knows when to let a gag die ; thus 
1976	too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise .
1977	a great ending does n't make up for a weak movie 
1978	dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or 
1979	its over-reliance on genre conventions 
1980	as an actor 
1981	a mostly tired retread of several other mob tales .
1982	i wish i could say `` thank god it 's friday '' 
1983	nothing about it fits .
1984	as it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends 
1985	somehow we 're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids 
1986	the cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big ... and the setting remains indistinct .
1987	consider the title 's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept .
1988	the movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable .
1989	i tried to read the time on my watch .
1990	the film makes a tragic error by going on for too long 
1991	johnson has 
1992	ultimately the project comes across as clinical 
1993	the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot 
1994	the film meant well in its horse tale about freedom 
1995	the movie is as far as you can get from racy 
1996	once the audience figure out what 's being said 
1997	there 's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought .
1998	it seems just a long 
1999	the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in 
2000	even by dumb action-movie standards 
2001	the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes .
2002	just a bloody mess .
2003	creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller .
2004	you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack 
2005	has something to say ... but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller .
2006	bears is bad .
2007	not ` terrible filmmaking ' bad 
2008	as is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions 
2009	george 
2010	for a film about two mismatched buddies 
2011	however clever nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging 
2012	extreme oops - oops 
2013	what could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent .
2014	what will 
2015	... too dull to enjoy .
2016	a morality tale whose thought-provoking potential is hampered by a made-for-tv look 
2017	here 's a self-congratulatory 3d imax rah-rah .
2018	eastwood is an icon of moviemaking 
2019	but even a hero can stumble sometimes .
2020	a sophomoric exploration of ` life problems ' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about .
2021	it 's all very cute 
2022	the impact of the armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day .
2023	going to the website may be just as fun -lrb- and scary -rrb- as going to the film .
2024	lacking gravitas 
2025	leave these flowers unpicked -- they 're dead on the vine .
2026	admirable 
2027	for caine lovers only .
2028	a shambles of a movie -- visually unattractive 
2029	de niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to clint eastwood in the lazy bloodwork .
2030	but like bruce springsteen 's gone-to-pot asbury park 
2031	no 
2032	a reasonably efficient mechanism 
2033	the rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is 
2034	human nature talks the talk 
2035	city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : it 's careful 
2036	but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing .
2037	the marquis de sade could n't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be .
2038	what could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama .
2039	the cast is uniformly excellent ... but the film itself is merely mildly charming .
2040	drives for the same kind of bittersweet 
2041	a bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 -lrb- k -rrb- statement .
2042	the whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit .
2043	fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters .
2044	and forget about any attempt at a plot !
2045	it will probably prove interesting to ram dass fans 
2046	take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we 've seen and all you have left are john leguizamo 's cool jackets .
2047	it 's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic oliver parker intends to mangle next time .
2048	showtime is closer to slowtime .
2049	it may be an easy swipe to take 
2050	the weight of water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire 
2051	` how many more voyages can this limping but dearly-loved franchise survive ? '
2052	despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title 
2053	fans of the tv series will be disappointed 
2054	the only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll .
2055	barely goes beyond comic book status .
2056	it 's disappointing when filmmakers throw a few big-name actors and cameos at a hokey script .
2057	i spy is an embarrassment 
2058	it 's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun .
2059	an eccentric little comic\/thriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality .
2060	afraid to pitch into farce 
2061	maybe it 's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages 
2062	-lrb- morgan -rrb- 
2063	passably entertaining but also mechanical and joyless .
2064	safe conduct 
2065	my response to the film is best described as lukewarm .
2066	maybe i found the proceedings a little bit too conventional .
2067	too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century .
2068	it 's push-the-limits teen comedy 
2069	it 's too long 
2070	a sudsy cautionary tale .
2071	a movie that tries to fuse the two ` woods ' but winds up a bolly-holly masala mess .
2072	mr. wedge and mr. saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well .
2073	their film falters 
2074	leaves you with a knot in your stomach 
2075	watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives .
2076	as your relatives swap one mundane story after another 
2077	unfortunately 
2078	on the right track to something that 's creepy and effective ... it 's just going to take more than a man in a bullwinkle costume to get there .
2079	the only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy 
2080	one of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly 
2081	... this movie has a glossy coat of action movie excess while remaining heartless at its core .
2082	murder by numbers is like a couple of mediocre tv-movie - of-the-week films clumsily stuck together .
2083	the film is surprisingly well-directed by brett ratner 
2084	warmed-over tarantino by way of wannabe elmore leonard .
2085	-lrb- sen 's -rrb- soap opera-ish approach undermines his good intentions .
2086	showtime is one of the hapless victims of the arrogant `` if we put together a wry white man and a chatty black man and give them guns 
2087	sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre .
2088	do n't waste your money .
2089	though certainly original in form 
2090	there are n't many laughs in this interesting study of the cultural mores of georgian jews in tel aviv .
2091	there 's not enough to sustain the comedy .
2092	like those to rome 
2093	we may get the full visceral impact of a ruthless army on the warpath but no sense of the devilish complexity of the balkans conflict .
2094	you 're better off staying home and watching the x-files .
2095	chaotic 
2096	bears resemblance to 
2097	this is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic beverage after another .
2098	friday after next has the same problem that next friday did -- it 's called where 's chris tucker when you need him ?
2099	this film is full of rabbits .
2100	brimful .
2101	but like most rabbits 
2102	i weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider blue crush to be an intelligent film about young women .
2103	i kept wishing i was watching a documentary about the wartime navajos and what they accomplished instead of all this specious hollywood hoo-ha .
2104	no number of fantastic sets 
2105	a movie far more cynical and lazy than anything a fictitious charlie kaufman might object to .
2106	could the country bears really be as bad as its trailers ?
2107	in a word -- yes .
2108	if high crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title .
2109	reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns 
2110	the movie makes absolutely no sense .
2111	its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ?
2112	the problem with this film is that it 's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot .
2113	had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent 
2114	despite the authenticity of the trappings 
2115	murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous .
2116	the journey toward redemption feels more like a cinematic experiment than a full-blown movie .
2117	that zhang would make such a strainingly cute film -- with a blind orphan at its center 
2118	the gantzes ' interviews tend to let the guys off the hook .
2119	the streets 
2120	this is a good movie in spurts 
2121	parker probably thinks he 's shaking up a classic the way kenneth branagh and baz luhrmann have 
2122	flotsam in the sea of moviemaking 
2123	a tv episode inflated past its natural length .
2124	involving at times 
2125	all these developments and challenges facing santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility .
2126	there are weird resonances between actor and role here 
2127	the unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive 
2128	the story ... is moldy and obvious .
2129	it 's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational 
2130	suffocated at conception by its munchausen-by-proxy mum .
2131	punish the vehicle to adore the star .
2132	even if britney spears is really cute 
2133	big fat liar is just futile silliness looking to tap into the kiddie sensibilities .
2134	usually when i get this much syrup 
2135	all the necessary exposition prevents the picture from rising above your generic sand 'n' sandal adventure .
2136	glib 
2137	gangs of new york is an unapologetic mess 
2138	an overblown clunker full of bad jokes 
2139	without a strong script and energetic acting 
2140	a mild 
2141	strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and b-film thuggery .
2142	schindler 's list it ai n't .
2143	a cinematic sleeping pill of impressive potency .
2144	it 's an awfully derivative story .
2145	it 's an earnest debut full of heartfelt performances 
2146	about as cutting-edge as pet rock : the movie .
2147	with generic sets and b-grade special effects 
2148	not sweet enough to liven up its predictable story and will leave even fans of hip-hop sorely disappointed .
2149	winds up feeling like lots of other quirky movies that try to score hipness points with young adults .
2150	oft-described as the antidote to american pie-type sex comedies 
2151	the pacing is glacial 
2152	the premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences .
2153	with its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere 
2154	it 's painful .
2155	an uneven film dealing with too many problems to be taken seriously .
2156	sheridan ... smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth .
2157	an atonal estrogen opera that demonizes feminism while gifting the most sympathetic male of the piece with a nice vomit bath at his wedding .
2158	half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations 
2159	writer\/director john mckay ignites some charming chemistry between kate and jed but 
2160	-lrb- newton -rrb- wanders through charlie completely unaware she needs to show some presence and star quality .
2161	unfortunately 
2162	i found it slow 
2163	a lousy movie that 's not merely unwatchable 
2164	the best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations .
2165	then lower them a bit more .
2166	when not obscured by the booming bass-heavy soundtrack 
2167	cliches are as thick as the cigarette smoke .
2168	a woozy 
2169	` abandon all hope 
2170	what begins as a seemingly brainless 
2171	a grim 
2172	birot 's directorial debut -lrb- she co-wrote the script with christophe honoré -rrb- is n't so much bad as it is bland .
2173	watching the film is like reading a times portrait of grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it .
2174	enough similarities to gymkata and howie long 's firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long-suffering eyeballs .
2175	succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the police academy series .
2176	christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their lord as a luv-spreading dr. feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists 
2177	if this dud had been made in the '70s 
2178	a frantic search for laughs 
2179	like a documentary version of fight club 
2180	`` an entire film about researchers quietly reading dusty old letters . ''
2181	pryor lite 
2182	what 's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete 
2183	the stories here suffer from the chosen format .
2184	while the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat 's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest 
2185	just how extreme are these ops ?
2186	i regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough .
2187	the actors are forced to grapple with hazy motivations that never come into focus .
2188	john leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie .
2189	the sequel has turned completely and irrevocably bizarre to the point of utter nonsense .
2190	hardly makes the kind of points egoyan wanted to make 
2191	rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down .
2192	the master of disaster - it 's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy .
2193	the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it is n't exactly kiddie-friendly ... alas 
2194	the stupidest 
2195	it 's so underwritten that you ca n't figure out just where the other characters 
2196	a film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not .
2197	none of this violates the letter of behan 's book 
2198	bad company leaves a bad taste 
2199	even if it ultimately disappoints 
2200	fails to bring as much to the table .
2201	a film made with as little wit 
2202	disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material .
2203	if you 're not the target demographic ... this movie is one long chick-flick slog .
2204	i hate this movie
2205	an imaginative comedy\/thriller .
2206	-lrb- a -rrb- rare 
2207	-lrb- an -rrb- hilarious romantic comedy .
2208	never -lrb- sinks -rrb- into exploitation .
2209	-lrb- u -rrb- nrelentingly stupid .
