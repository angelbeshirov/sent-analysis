2090	4	a	the performers are so spot on

2096	3	a	it works well enough

2105	4	a	-lrb- westbrook -rrb- makes a wonderful subject for the camera .
2106	3	a	a film that 's flawed and brilliant in equal measure .
2107	3	a	even if invincible is not quite the career peak that the pianist is for roman polanski 
2108	1	a	ultimately too repellent to fully endear itself to american art house audiences 
2109	3	a	hardly a film that comes along every day .
2110	4	a	a wild ride with eight boarders from venice beach that was a deserved co-winner of the audience award for documentaries at the sundance film festival .
2111	2	a	the film 's only missteps come from the script 's insistence on providing deep emotional motivation for each and every one of abagnale 's antics .

2118	3	a	moonlight mile does n't quite go the distance but the cast is impressive and they all give life to these broken characters who are trying to make their way through this tragedy .
2119	2	a	it is an indelible epic american story about two families 
2120	3	a	not as well-written as sexy beast 
2121	4	a	quite simply 
2122	2	a	a flawed film but an admirable one that tries to immerse us in a world of artistic abandon and political madness and very nearly succeeds .
2123	3	a	the filmmakers wisely decided to let crocodile hunter steve irwin do what he does best 
2124	3	a	a winning and wildly fascinating work .
2125	1	a	we do get the distinct impression that this franchise is drawing to a close .
2126	3	a	worth catching for griffiths ' warm and winning central performance .
2127	2	a	the tone errs on the shrill side 
2128	4	a	an interesting psychological game of cat-and-mouse

2138	4	a	there are n't too many films that can be as simultaneously funny

2147	1	a	as underwater ghost stories go 
2148	2	a	it is a challenging film 
2149	3	a	trapped wo n't score points for political correctness 
2150	3	a	a rock-solid gangster movie with a fair amount of suspense 
2151	3	a	it 's incredible the number of stories the holocaust has generated .
2152	3	a	just when you think that every possible angle has been exhausted by documentarians 
2153	3	a	as they used to say in the 1950s sci-fi movies 
2154	3	a	there 's no conversion effort 
2155	4	a	like a skillful fisher 
2156	3	a	a film with contemporary political resonance illustrated by a winning family story .
2157	4	a	kids five and up will be delighted with the fast

2159	4	a	an unsettling 
2160	2	a	maid in manhattan might not look so appealing on third or fourth viewing down the road ... but as a high concept vehicle for two bright stars of the moment who can rise to fans ' lofty expectations 
2161	4	a	much of all about lily chou-chou is mesmerizing : some of its plaintiveness could make you weep .
2162	4	a	ferrara 's strongest and most touching movie of recent years .
2163	4	a	spielberg 's first real masterpiece 
2164	1	a	the screenwriters dig themselves in deeper every time they toss logic and science into what is essentially a `` dungeons and dragons '' fantasy with modern military weaponry ...
2165	2	a	more than simply a portrait of early extreme sports 
2166	4	a	what i saw 
2167	3	a	the level of acting elevates the material above pat inspirational status and gives it a sturdiness and solidity that we 've long associated with washington the actor .
2168	3	a	a deft 
2169	3	a	daringly perceptive 
2170	3	a	delivers more than its fair share of saucy hilarity .
2171	3	a	a fairly enjoyable mixture of longest yard ... and the 1999 guy ritchie caper lock stock and two smoking barrels .
2172	3	a	happily 
2173	3	a	for proof of that on the cinematic front 
2174	4	a	hugely entertaining from start to finish 
2175	3	a	it 's not like having a real film of nijinsky 
2176	3	a	it 's probably worth catching solely on its visual merits .
2177	1	a	if only it had the story to match .
2178	2	a	like other great documentaries ... this goes after one truth -lrb- the ford administration 's complicity in tearing ` orphans ' from their mothers -rrb- and stumbles upon others even more compelling .
2179	2	a	... only bond can save us from the latest eccentric 
2180	2	a	the first half bursts with a goofy energy previous disney films only used for a few minutes here and there .
2181	1	a	it 's quite diverting nonsense .
2182	3	a	an old-fashioned scary movie 
2183	3	a	for all the wit and hoopla 
2184	4	a	what makes how i killed my father compelling 
2185	2	a	renner ?
2186	2	a	s face is chillingly unemotive 
2187	3	a	see it for his performance if nothing else .
2188	4	a	... the kind of entertainment that parents love to have their kids see .
2189	4	a	it 's a fine 
2190	4	a	its engaging simplicity is driven by appealing leads .
2191	4	a	swimming is above all about a young woman 's face 
2192	2	a	a respectable venture on its own terms 
2193	3	a	it 's weird 
2194	3	a	an elegant film with often surprising twists and an intermingling of naiveté and sophistication .
2195	3	a	blessed with two fine 
2196	2	a	while this has the making of melodrama 
2197	4	a	as a girl-meets-girl romantic comedy 
2198	1	a	yet it 's not quite the genre-busting film it 's been hyped to be because it plays everything too safe .
2199	1	a	you do n't need to know your ice-t 's from your cool-j 's to realize that as far as these shootings are concerned 
2200	4	a	turturro is fabulously funny and over the top as a ` very sneaky ' butler who excels in the art of impossible disappearing\/reappearing acts
2201	2	a	meant for star wars fans .
2202	2	a	it is there to give them a good time .
2203	4	a	from a deceptively simple premise 
2204	4	a	simply and eloquently articulates the tangled feelings of particular new yorkers deeply touched by an unprecedented tragedy .
2205	4	a	provides a very moving and revelatory footnote to the holocaust .
2206	4	a	terrific performances 
2207	3	a	a little uneven to be the cat 's meow 
2208	4	a	it 's a compelling and horrifying story 
2209	3	a	i like it .
2210	3	a	there is a freedom to watching stunts that are this crude 
2211	4	a	that rare documentary that incorporates so much of human experience -- drama 
2212	4	a	that rare movie that works on any number of levels -- as a film of magic and whimsy for children 
2213	3	a	it 's both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue 
2214	3	a	a sharp and quick documentary that is funny and pithy 
2215	4	a	the film does a solid job of slowly 
2216	3	a	fred schepisi 's tale of four englishmen facing the prospect of their own mortality views youthful affluence not as a lost ideal but a starting point .
2217	2	a	the directive to protect the code at all costs also begins to blur as the importance of the man and the code merge

2224	3	a	i do n't know if frailty will turn bill paxton into an a-list director 
2225	3	a	despite its flaws ... belinsky is still able to create an engaging story that keeps you guessing at almost every turn .

2258	4	a	a lot of fun 
2259	4	a	promises is one film that 's truly deserving of its oscar nomination .
2260	3	a	what bubbles up out of john c. walsh 's pipe dream is the distinct and very welcome sense of watching intelligent people making a movie they might actually want to watch .
2261	2	a	if reno is to the left of liberal on the political spectrum 
2262	3	a	beautiful 
2263	4	a	ms. hutchins is talented enough and charismatic enough to make us care about zelda 's ultimate fate .

2275	4	a	driven by a fantastic dual performance from ian holm ... the film is funny 
2276	3	a	a well-put-together piece of urban satire .

2319	2	a	it 's not particularly subtle ... however

2381	4	a	the movie is ingenious fun .

2383	2	a	the combination of lightness and strictness in this instance gives italian for beginners an amiable aimlessness that keeps it from seeming predictably formulaic .
2384	3	a	the script is smart and dark - hallelujah for small favors .
2385	4	a	an intelligent 
2386	3	a	mr. polanski is in his element here : alone 
2387	4	a	spectacular in every sense of the word 
2388	3	a	this is n't exactly profound cinema 
2389	4	a	this is a finely written 
2390	3	a	tres greek writer and star nia vardalos has crafted here a worldly-wise and very funny script .
2391	3	a	a tasty appetizer that leaves you wanting more .
2392	3	a	it gives devastating testimony to both people 's capacity for evil and their heroic capacity for good .
2393	3	a	the film reminds me of a vastly improved germanic version of my big fat greek wedding -- with better characters 
2394	3	a	the difference is that i truly enjoyed most of mostly martha while i ne
2395	4	a	morton deserves an oscar nomination .
2396	4	a	a colorful 
2397	3	a	the screenplay never lets us forget that bourne was once an amoral assassin just like the ones who are pursuing him ... there is never really a true `` us '' versus `` them '' .
2398	4	a	the history is fascinating ; the action is dazzling .
2399	1	a	they just do n't work in concert .
2400	3	a	for those in search of something different 
2401	3	a	a lovely film for the holiday season .
2402	2	a	it remains to be seen whether statham can move beyond the crime-land action genre

2404	4	a	it 's a fairy tale that comes from a renowned indian film culture that allows americans to finally revel in its splendor .
2405	4	a	at once subtle and visceral 
2406	3	a	the performances of the children 
2407	3	a	despite its lavish formalism and intellectual austerity 
2408	3	a	this rush to profits has created a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness 
2409	4	a	adams 
2410	3	a	a completely spooky piece of business that gets under your skin and 
2411	4	a	superbly photographed and staged by mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen .
2412	4	a	the ensemble cast turns in a collectively stellar performance 
2413	3	a	not quite as miraculous as its dreamworks makers would have you believe 
2414	3	a	a properly spooky film about the power of spirits to influence us whether we believe in them or not .
2415	3	a	the lightest

2431	4	a	noyce has worked wonders with the material .
2432	3	a	it 's mostly a pleasure to watch .
2433	3	a	and the reason for that is a self-aware 
2434	3	a	the chateau is a risky venture that never quite goes where you expect and often surprises you with unexpected comedy .
2435	3	a	a very well-meaning movie 
2436	3	a	there are n't many conclusive answers in the film 
2437	4	a	vividly demonstrates that the director of such hollywood blockbusters as patriot games can still turn out a small 
2438	3	a	a four star performance from kevin kline who unfortunately works with a two star script .
2439	3	a	dogtown & z-boys evokes the blithe rebel fantasy with the kind of insouciance embedded in the sexy demise of james dean .
2440	2	a	if you do n't flee 
2441	2	a	if you do n't laugh 
2442	3	a	payne constructs a hilarious ode to middle america and middle age with this unlikely odyssey 
2443	3	a	koury frighteningly and honestly exposes one teenager 's uncomfortable class resentment and 
2444	3	a	the santa clause 2 proves itself a more streamlined and thought out encounter than the original could ever have hoped to be .
2445	3	a	now as a former gong show addict 
2446	3	a	succeeds where its recent predecessor miserably fails because it demands that you suffer the dreadfulness of war from both sides .
2447	3	a	the first bond movie in ages that is n't fake fun .
2448	4	a	this odd 
2449	4	a	a film centering on a traditional indian wedding in contemporary new delhi may not sound like specialized fare 
2450	4	a	a weird and wonderful comedy .
2451	3	a	the movie should jolt you out of your seat a couple of times 
2452	3	a	has the capability of effecting change and inspiring hope .
2453	4	a	a first-class 
2454	4	a	labute 's careful handling makes the material seem genuine rather than pandering .

2460	3	a	a wonderful 
2461	4	a	amid the new populist comedies that underscore the importance of family tradition and familial community 
2462	3	a	parris ' performance is credible and remarkably mature .
2463	2	a	` enigma ' is the kind of engaging historical drama that hollywood appears to have given up on in favor of sentimental war movies in the vein of ` we were soldiers . '
2464	3	a	munch 's screenplay is tenderly observant of his characters .
2465	3	a	he watches them as they float within the seas of their personalities .
2466	2	a	his scenes are short and often unexpected .
2467	3	a	it grabs you in the dark and shakes you vigorously for its duration .
2468	2	a	leigh 's daring here is that without once denying the hardscrabble lives of people on the economic fringes of margaret thatcher 's ruinous legacy 
2469	3	a	hashiguchi vividly captures the way young japanese live now 
2470	3	a	uneven but a lot of fun .
2471	3	a	i know that i 'll never listen to marvin gaye or the supremes the same way again
2472	4	a	the two leads 
2473	3	a	not as good as the full monty 
2474	3	a	whenever it threatens to get bogged down in earnest dramaturgy

2476	3	a	unfolds as one of the most politically audacious films of recent decades from any country 
2477	3	a	this real-life hollywood fairy-tale is more engaging than the usual fantasies hollywood produces .
2478	3	a	the graphic carnage and re-creation of war-torn croatia is uncomfortably timely 
2479	3	a	left me with the visceral sensation of longing 
2480	3	a	the characters are more deeply thought through than in most ` right-thinking ' films .
2481	3	a	crammed with incident

2492	4	a	works because reno does n't become smug or sanctimonious towards the audience .
2493	3	a	nettelbeck ... has a pleasing way with a metaphor .
2494	2	a	a pure participatory event that malnourished intellectuals will gulp down in a frenzy .
2495	3	a	the cast delivers without sham the raw-nerved story .
2496	3	a	steven soderbergh 's digital video experiment is a clever and cutting 
2497	3	a	the film 's highlight is definitely its screenplay

2519	1	a	that 's its first sign of trouble .
2520	3	a	a dazzling thing to behold -- as long as you 're wearing the somewhat cumbersome 3d goggles the theater provides .
2521	3	a	be patient with the lovely hush !
2522	4	a	and your reward will be a thoughtful 
2523	4	a	the large-format film is well suited to capture these musicians in full regalia and the incredible imax sound system lets you feel the beat down to your toes .
2524	4	a	godard has never made a more sheerly beautiful film than this unexpectedly moving meditation on love 
2525	4	a	the kind of movie that comes along only occasionally

2527	3	a	by the end you ca n't help but feel ` stoked . '
2528	3	a	the off-center humor is a constant

2532	4	a	sparkling 
2533	3	a	even if you 're an agnostic carnivore 
2534	2	a	where bowling for columbine is at its most valuable is in its examination of america 's culture of fear as a root cause of gun violence .
2535	3	a	the result is somewhat satisfying -- it still comes from spielberg 
2536	1	a	but it 's also disappointing to a certain degree .
2537	4	a	the all-french cast is marveilleux .
2538	3	a	there 's a lot to recommend read my lips .

2616	4	a	ong 's promising debut is a warm and well-told tale of one recent chinese immigrant 's experiences in new york city .
2617	4	a	that the real antwone fisher was able to overcome his personal obstacles and become a good man is a wonderful thing ; that he has been able to share his story so compellingly with us is a minor miracle .
2618	2	a	there 's not much to fatale 
2619	3	a	what redeems the film is the cast 
2620	3	a	beautiful 
2621	3	a	it 's up to -lrb- watts -rrb- to lend credibility to this strange scenario 
2622	2	a	the film is darkly atmospheric 
2623	3	a	shyamalan takes a potentially trite and overused concept -lrb- aliens come to earth -rrb- and infuses it into a rustic 
2624	3	a	... the story 
2625	1	a	it 's plotless 
2626	3	a	indeed 
2627	3	a	gondry 's direction is adequate ... but what gives human nature its unique feel is kaufman 's script .
2628	3	a	the film 's plot may be shallow 
2629	3	a	with a large cast representing a broad cross-section 
2630	3	a	the observations of this social\/economic\/urban environment are canny and spiced with irony .
2631	4	a	renner carries much of the film with a creepy and dead-on performance .
2632	2	a	jarecki and gibney do find enough material to bring kissinger 's record into question and explain how the diplomat 's tweaked version of statecraft may have cost thousands and possibly millions of lives .
2633	3	a	the spaniel-eyed jean reno infuses hubert with a mixture of deadpan cool 
2634	3	a	aniston has at last decisively broken with her friends image in an independent film of satiric fire and emotional turmoil .
2635	2	a	a mildly enjoyable if toothless adaptation of a much better book .
2636	3	a	unexpected 
2637	4	a	300 years of russian history and culture compressed into an evanescent

2639	3	a	may take its sweet time to get wherever it 's going 
2640	3	a	less the sensational true-crime hell-jaunt purists might like and more experimental in its storytelling -lrb- though no less horrifying for it -rrb- .
2641	4	a	the film is one of the year 's best .
2642	1	a	eerily accurate depiction of depression .
2643	4	a	... a delicious crime drama on par with the slickest of mamet .
2644	3	a	charming and witty 
2645	4	a	directed with purpose and finesse by england 's roger mitchell 
2646	3	a	escapes the precious trappings of most romantic comedies 
2647	2	a	this big screen caper has a good bark 
2648	3	a	-lrb- allen -rrb- manages to breathe life into this somewhat tired premise .
2649	2	a	i have two words to say about reign of fire .
2650	3	a	great dragons !
2651	3	a	by surrounding us with hyper-artificiality 
2652	3	a	a deliberative account of a lifestyle characterized by its surface-obsession -- one that typifies the delirium of post 
2653	3	a	superb production values & christian bale 's charisma make up for a derivative plot .
2654	4	a	the film has the courage of its convictions and excellent performances on its side .
2655	3	a	i know i should n't have laughed 
2656	3	a	a movie that will thrill you 
2657	3	a	it 's a smart 
2658	2	a	more vaudeville show than well-constructed narrative 
2659	4	a	the case is a convincing one 
2660	3	a	the actresses find their own rhythm and protect each other from the script 's bad ideas and awkwardness .
2661	2	a	diverting french comedy in which a husband has to cope with the pesky moods of jealousy .
2662	4	a	captivates and shows how a skillful filmmaker can impart a message without bludgeoning the audience over the head .
2663	4	a	there is a welcome lack of pretension about the film 
2664	3	a	coy but exhilarating 
2665	3	a	it is a likable story 
2666	4	a	not only does spider-man deliver 
2667	3	a	tackles the difficult subject of grief and loss with such life-embracing spirit that the theme does n't drag an audience down .

2674	3	a	using an endearing cast 
2675	4	a	when a movie has stuck around for this long 
2676	4	a	it 's that good .
2677	4	a	smart 
2678	4	a	forget about one oscar nomination for julianne moore this year - she should get all five .
2679	3	a	japanese director shohei imamura 's latest film is an odd but ultimately satisfying blend of the sophomoric and the sublime .
2680	3	a	kwan is a master of shadow 
2681	3	a	while the plot follows a predictable connect-the-dots course ... director john schultz colors the picture in some evocative shades .
2682	3	a	katz 's documentary does n't have much panache 
2683	2	a	we get an image of big papa spanning history 
2684	3	a	evelyn 's strong cast and surehanded direction make for a winning 
2685	4	a	a conventional but heartwarming tale .
2686	4	a	this is one of the outstanding thrillers of recent years .
2687	3	a	skins has a desolate air 
2688	3	a	a film of quiet power .
2689	4	a	more concerned with overall feelings 
2690	3	a	an intelligent romantic thriller of a very old-school kind of quality .
2691	3	a	the sword fighting is well done and auteuil is a goofy pleasure .
2692	3	a	yes 
2693	2	a	film ca n't quite maintain its initial momentum 
2694	3	a	o fantasma is boldly 
2695	2	a	it 's still adam sandler 
2696	3	a	and for many of us 
2697	3	a	here 's yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix .
2698	3	a	lee 's achievement extends to his supple understanding of the role that brown played in american culture as an athlete 
2699	2	a	kaufman and jonze take huge risks to ponder the whole notion of passion -- our desire as human beings for passion in our lives and the emptiness one feels when it is missing .
2700	4	a	it tends to remind one of a really solid woody allen film 
2701	4	a	while centered on the life experiences of a particular theatrical family 
2702	3	a	the film 
2703	4	a	the immersive powers of the giant screen and its hyper-realistic images are put to perfect use in the breathtakingly beautiful outer-space documentary space station 3d .
2704	3	a	has an unmistakable 
2705	4	a	more than anything else 
2706	3	a	this movie has the usual impossible stunts ... but it has just as many scenes that are lean and tough enough to fit in any modern action movie .
2707	4	a	mostly works because of the universal themes 
2708	2	a	... the one thing this wild film has that other imax films do n't : chimps 
2709	4	a	that 's fun for kids of any age .
2710	4	a	writer\/director david caesar ladles on the local flavour with a hugely enjoyable film about changing times 
2711	4	a	rarely have i seen a film so willing to champion the fallibility of the human heart .
2712	4	a	holofcener rejects patent solutions to dramatize life 's messiness from inside out 
2713	4	a	like the full monty 
2714	4	a	... a gleefully grungy 
2715	4	a	kinnear and dafoe give what may be the performances of their careers .
2716	3	a	all in all 
2717	4	a	a moving story of determination and the human spirit .
2718	3	a	`` brown sugar '' admirably aspires to be more than another `` best man '' clone by weaving a theme throughout this funny film .
2719	3	a	-lrb- gulpilil -rrb- is a commanding screen presence 
2720	4	a	an effortlessly accomplished and richly resonant work .
2721	2	a	in some ways 
2722	4	a	except it 's much 
2723	2	a	though it never rises to its full potential as a film 
2724	3	a	scotland looks wonderful 
2725	3	a	what enlivens this film 
2726	4	a	the emotion is impressively true for being so hot-blooded 
2727	3	a	although it lacks the detail of the book 
2728	4	a	i 'd watch these two together again in a new york minute .
2729	4	a	there 's nothing like love to give a movie a b-12 shot 
2730	3	a	a moving essay about the specter of death 
2731	3	a	this film is so different from the apple and so striking that it can only encourage us to see samira makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility 
2732	2	a	like a less dizzily gorgeous companion to mr. wong 's in the mood for love -- very much a hong kong movie despite its mainland setting .
2733	2	a	... a somber film 
2734	3	a	coral reef adventure is a heavyweight film that fights a good fight on behalf of the world 's endangered reefs -- and it lets the pictures do the punching .
2735	4	a	the overall result is an intelligent 
2736	4	a	poignant and moving 
2737	3	a	worth a salute just for trying to be more complex than your average film .
2738	3	a	handsome and sophisticated approach to the workplace romantic comedy .
2739	4	a	a shimmeringly lovely coming-of-age portrait 
2740	3	a	while cherish does n't completely survive its tonal transformation from dark comedy to suspense thriller 
2741	2	a	in many ways 
2742	4	a	we admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears 
2743	3	a	an often watchable 
2744	4	a	the entire cast is first-rate 
2745	3	a	the cat 's meow marks a return to form for director peter bogdanovich ...
2746	2	a	this one is strictly a lightweight escapist film .
2747	4	a	this sensitive 
2748	2	a	the culmination of everyone 's efforts is given life when a selection appears in its final form -lrb- in `` last dance '' -rrb- .
2749	3	a	in questioning the election process 
2750	4	a	a very charming and funny movie .
2751	3	a	this is a film that manages to find greatness in the hue of its drastic iconography .
2752	2	a	streamlined to a tight 
2753	4	a	consummate actor barry has done excellent work here .
2754	2	a	the biggest problem with this movie is that it 's not nearly long enough .
2755	1	a	while not all that bad of a movie 
2756	2	a	ali 's graduation from little screen to big is far less painful than his opening scene encounter with an over-amorous terrier .
2757	3	a	i have always appreciated a smartly written motion picture 
2758	4	a	you can sip your vintage wines and watch your merchant ivory productions ; i 'll settle for a nice cool glass of iced tea and a jerry bruckheimer flick any day of the week .
2759	2	a	may be the most undeserving victim of critical overkill since town and country .
2760	3	a	a chilly 
2761	3	a	the movie does its best to work us over 
2762	3	a	cold 
2763	3	a	becomes a fascinating study of isolation and frustration that successfully recreates both the physical setting and emotional tensions of the papin sisters .
2764	2	a	spend your benjamins on a matinee .
2765	3	a	all in all 
2766	3	a	worth seeing just for weaver and lapaglia .
2767	4	a	a pleasant piece of escapist entertainment .
2768	3	a	among the many pleasures are the lively intelligence of the artists and their perceptiveness about their own situations .
2769	3	a	it 's consistently funny 
2770	3	a	it 's the cute frissons of discovery and humor between chaplin and kidman that keep this nicely wound clock not just ticking 
2771	3	a	the storytelling may be ordinary 
2772	2	a	there 's something about a marching band that gets me where i live .
2773	4	a	cuaron repeatedly 
2774	3	a	it 's definitely an improvement on the first blade 
2775	4	a	a slam-bang extravaganza that is all about a wild-and-woolly 
2776	1	a	what 's infuriating about full frontal is that it 's too close to real life to make sense .
2777	3	a	what 's invigorating about it is that it does n't give a damn .
2778	2	a	is red dragon worthy of a place alongside the other hannibal movies ?
2779	3	a	as hannibal would say 
2780	4	a	writer-director juan carlos fresnadillo makes a feature debut that is fully formed and remarkably assured .
2781	4	a	insightfully written 
2782	0	a	perhaps the grossest movie ever made .
2783	2	a	funny 
2784	3	a	this 90-minute postmodern voyage was more diverting and thought-provoking than i 'd expected it to be .
2785	4	a	one of those exceedingly rare films in which the talk alone is enough to keep us involved .
2786	4	a	a heartbreakingly thoughtful minor classic 
2787	3	a	an affectionately goofy satire that 's unafraid to throw elbows when necessary ...
2788	4	a	between them 
2789	2	a	jackson tries to keep the plates spinning as best he can 
2790	3	a	filmmakers david weissman and bill weber benefit enormously from the cockettes ' camera craziness -- not only did they film performances 
2791	3	a	interesting both as a historical study and as a tragic love story .
2792	4	a	a stylish but steady 
2793	4	a	it picked me up 
2794	3	a	graham greene 's novel of colonialism and empire is elevated by michael caine 's performance as a weary journalist in a changing world .
2795	3	a	though it 's equally solipsistic in tone 
2796	3	a	compulsively watchable 
2797	3	a	delivers roughly equal amounts of beautiful movement and inside information .
2798	3	a	bon appétit !
2799	4	a	just like a splendid meal 
2800	3	a	the structure is simple 
2801	4	a	this charming 
2802	3	a	some people march to the beat of a different drum 
2803	3	a	playfully profound ... and crazier than michael jackson on the top floor of a skyscraper nursery surrounded by open windows .
2804	3	a	a film that will enthrall the whole family .
2805	3	a	the charm of the first movie is still there 
2806	3	a	k 19 stays afloat as decent drama\/action flick
2807	4	a	it sends you away a believer again and quite cheered at just that .
2808	4	a	like the best 60 minutes exposé 
2809	2	a	an 83 minute document of a project which started in a muddle 
2810	4	a	an emotionally and spiritually compelling journey seen through the right eyes 
2811	2	a	nair does n't use -lrb- monsoon wedding -rrb- to lament the loss of culture .
2812	3	a	instead 
2813	3	a	both grant and hoult carry the movie because they are believable as people -- flawed 
2814	2	a	leading a double life in an american film only comes to no good 
2815	3	a	matters play out realistically if not always fairly .
2816	3	a	in the affable maid in manhattan 
2817	2	a	like mike is a harmlessly naïve slice of b-ball fantasy 
2818	3	a	though writer\/director bart freundlich 's film ultimately becomes a simplistic story about a dysfunctional parent-child relationship 
2819	3	a	what the movie lacks in action it more than makes up for in drama 
2820	3	a	just offbeat enough to keep you interested without coming close to bowling you over .
2821	3	a	probes in a light-hearted way the romantic problems of individuals for whom the yearning for passion spells discontent .
2822	4	a	what elevates the movie above the run-of-the-mill singles blender is its surreal sense of humor and technological finish .
2823	4	a	a film about female friendship that men can embrace and women will talk about for hours .
2824	0	a	the directing and story are disjointed 
2825	3	a	but the actors make this worth a peek .
2826	4	a	light the candles 
2827	2	a	it may be about drug dealers 
2828	2	a	massoud 's story is an epic 
2829	3	a	if villainous vampires are your cup of blood 
2830	3	a	drumline ably captures the complicated relationships in a marching band .
2831	4	a	because the film deliberately lacks irony 
2832	3	a	does point the way for adventurous indian filmmakers toward a crossover into nonethnic markets .
2833	4	a	seems based on ugly ideas instead of ugly behavior 
2834	2	a	`` sum '' is jack ryan 's `` do-over . ''
2835	4	a	give credit to everyone from robinson down to the key grip that this bold move works .
2836	4	a	especially give credit to affleck .
2837	4	a	an intelligently made -lrb- and beautifully edited -rrb- picture that at the very least has a spark of life to it -- more than you can say for plenty of movies that flow through the hollywood pipeline without a hitch .
2838	3	a	a terrific date movie 
2839	3	a	not all of the stories work and the ones that do are thin and scattered 
2840	2	a	what it lacks in originality it makes up for in effective if cheap moments of fright and dread .
2841	3	a	the pain 
2842	4	a	a gem of a movie .
2843	3	a	witty 
2844	4	a	it 's all stitched together with energy 
2845	4	a	miller comes at film with bracing intelligence and a vision both painterly and literary .
2846	4	a	the film is moody 
2847	3	a	eight legged freaks is clever and funny 
2848	3	a	this is historical filmmaking without the balm of right-thinking ideology 
2849	3	a	mr. scorsese 's bravery and integrity in advancing this vision can hardly be underestimated .
2850	3	a	a thriller whose style 
2851	4	a	it 's a hoot watching the rock chomp on jumbo ants 
2852	4	a	returning director rob minkoff ... and screenwriter bruce joel rubin ... have done a fine job of updating white 's dry wit to a new age .
2853	4	a	unfolds with such a wallop of you-are-there immediacy that when the bullets start to fly 
2854	4	a	a strong script 
2855	2	a	an unflinching look at the world 's dispossessed .
2856	3	a	if the film fails to fulfill its own ambitious goals 
2857	4	a	polanski has found the perfect material with which to address his own world war ii experience in his signature style .
2858	3	a	it is life affirming and heartbreaking 
2859	3	a	an off-beat and fanciful film about the human need for monsters to blame for all that is amiss in the world .
2860	4	a	a colorful 
2861	3	a	frei assembles a fascinating profile of a deeply humanistic artist who 
2862	3	a	nicely combines the enigmatic features of ` memento ' with the hallucinatory drug culture of ` requiem for a dream . '
2863	4	a	a well paced and satisfying little drama that deserved better than a ` direct-to-video ' release .
2864	3	a	the best part about `` gangs '' was daniel day-lewis .
2865	3	a	a treat for its depiction on not giving up on dreams when you 're a struggling nobody .
2866	4	a	one of those rare films that seems as though it was written for no one 
2867	3	a	a gripping documentary that reveals how deep the antagonism lies in war-torn jerusalem .
2868	3	a	director chris wedge and screenwriters michael berg 
2869	2	a	one of the film 's most effective aspects is its tchaikovsky soundtrack of neurasthenic regret .
2870	2	a	solondz creates some effective moments of discomfort for character and viewer alike .
2871	3	a	the film 's appeal has a lot to do with the casting of juliette binoche as sand 
2872	4	a	i was amused and entertained by the unfolding of bielinsky 's cleverly constructed scenario 
2873	3	a	somehow ms. griffiths and mr. pryce bring off this wild welsh whimsy .
2874	4	a	more mature than fatal attraction 
2875	3	a	for all the dolorous trim 
2876	4	a	a fanciful drama about napoleon 's last years and his surprising discovery of love and humility .
2877	2	a	a highly personal look at the effects of living a dysfunctionally privileged lifestyle 
2878	4	a	eric schweig and graham greene both exude an air of dignity that 's perfect for the proud warrior that still lingers in the souls of these characters .
2879	3	a	lovely and amazing is holofcener 's deep 
2880	3	a	when all is said and done 
2881	3	a	campbell scott finds the ideal outlet for his flick-knife diction in the role of roger swanson .
2882	4	a	-lrb- fiji diver rusi vulakoro and the married couple howard and michelle hall -rrb- show us the world they love and make us love it 
2883	3	a	russian ark is a new treasure of the hermitage .
2884	4	a	the animated sequences are well done and perfectly constructed to convey a sense of childhood imagination and creating adventure out of angst .
2885	3	a	it 's definitely a step in the right direction .

2897	4	a	what makes salton sea surprisingly engrossing is that caruso takes an atypically hypnotic approach to a world that 's often handled in fast-edit 
2898	2	a	a hidden-agenda drama that shouts classic french nuance .
2899	3	a	with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams

2917	3	a	for every cheesy scene 
2918	3	a	what sets ms. birot 's film apart from others in the genre is a greater attention to the parents -- and particularly the fateful fathers -- in the emotional evolution of the two bewitched adolescents .
2919	3	a	all three women deliver remarkable performances .
2920	3	a	claire is a terrific role for someone like judd 
2921	2	a	it 's clear that mehta simply wanted to update her beloved genre for the thousands of indians who fancy themselves too sophisticated for the cheese-laced spectacles that pack 'em in on the subcontinent .
2922	3	a	compassionately explores the seemingly irreconcilable situation between conservative christian parents and their estranged gay and lesbian children .
2923	4	a	the soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission .

2928	4	a	a visual spectacle full of stunning images and effects .
2929	3	a	a gentle and engrossing character study .
2930	3	a	it 's enough to watch huppert scheming 
2931	3	a	an engrossing portrait of uncompromising artists trying to create something original against the backdrop of a corporate music industry that only seems to care about the bottom line .
2932	3	a	a mischievous visual style and oodles of charm make ` cherish ' a very good -lrb- but not great -rrb- movie .
