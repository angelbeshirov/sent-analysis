# Sentiment analysis

My implementation of the Recursive Neural Tensor Network of Richar Socher (for more information [click here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/~socherr/EMNLP2013_RNTN.pdf)). 
The project also provides scripts for fine-tuning BERT and XLNet which are currently state of the art for sentiment analysis as well as base-line Naive-Bayes model. 
The comparison between the different models is done on the SST-2 and SST-5 datasets.
